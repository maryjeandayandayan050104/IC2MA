# JAVA

This repository is a collection of my original work, developed and released by me. Some of these programs were created as part of previous assignments that required personalized code, while others were crafted as enjoyable practice exercises. A portion of these projects also originated from activities during my senior high school years. Furthermore, I am committed to expanding this repository with additional Java projects.
